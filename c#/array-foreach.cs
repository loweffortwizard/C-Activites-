	Arrays.
	
	What is an array?
	An array is a variable type that allows a 
	programmer to group together multiple values of the same
	type in to a single collection.
	
	Why bother with arrays?
	Arrays make programs more efficient, 
	for example, imagine that we wanted to keep track 
	of scores
	in a game using a score board, 
	which keeps track of the top 10 scores. 
	Using the knowledge we have
	so far, we would create 10 integer variables â€“ 
	one for each score:
	
	Arrays start at 0.
	structure:
	
	type[]varname = new type[num];

#array scores = between 10 allocations with the following data. 
int[] scores = new int[10] {100, 95, 98, 80, 75, 72, 68, 61, 59, 55};

#foreach value in array scores
foreach(int score in scores)
{
	#print scores
	Console.WriteLine("Someone had a score of " + score);
}//end foreach

#end console.
Console.ReadKey();
